- **Solution**: Refactored router with proper authentication flow and single route definitions
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Impact**: Eliminated navigation errors and route conflicts

### 2. Error Boundary Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Issue**: No error boundaries to catch React component crashes
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive ErrorBoundary component with fallback UI
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Impact**: Prevents application crashes and provides graceful error handling

### 3. Input Validation Security (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: No server-side input validation
- **Solution**: Comprehensive Zod schema validation middleware for all endpoints
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Impact**: Prevents malicious input and ensures data integrity

### 4. Rate Limiting Protection (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: No rate limiting allowing potential abuse
- **Solution**: Multi-tier rate limiting (auth: 10/15min, general: 100/15min, bidding: 10/min)
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Impact**: Protects against DDoS and abuse attempts

### 5. Performance Optimization (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Issue**: No code splitting or performance monitoring
- **Solution**: React lazy loading, database connection pooling, performance middleware
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Impact**: Faster load times and better resource utilization

### 6. Security Hardening (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Missing security headers and protections
- **Solution**: CSRF protection, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, security headers
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Impact**: Enterprise-grade security compliance

### 7. Health Monitoring (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Issue**: No application health monitoring
- **Solution**: Comprehensive health check endpoints for database, memory, and application
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Impact**: Proactive monitoring and alerting capabilities

### 8. Database Connection Management (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Issue**: Basic database connection without optimization
- **Solution**: Production connection pool (20 max, 30s idle timeout, health monitoring)
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Impact**: Better scalability and connection management

### 9. Caching Strategy (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Issue**: No caching implementation
- **Solution**: Multi-tier caching (static: 24h, public: 15m, search: 10m, user: 5m)
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Impact**: Reduced database load and faster response times

### 10. Test Coverage (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Issue**: No production-ready test suite
- **Solution**: Comprehensive test coverage (authentication, API, performance, security)
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Impact**: Confidence in production deployment
