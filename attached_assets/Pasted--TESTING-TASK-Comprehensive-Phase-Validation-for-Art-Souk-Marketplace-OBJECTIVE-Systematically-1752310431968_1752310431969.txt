# TESTING TASK: Comprehensive Phase Validation for Art Souk Marketplace

## OBJECTIVE
Systematically test all implemented marketplace features to ensure functionality, user experience, and platform stability across all user roles and workflows.

## TESTING METHODOLOGY

### 🔍 TESTING APPROACH
Execute tests in this exact order:
1. **Smoke Tests** - Verify basic functionality works
2. **User Flow Tests** - Test complete user journeys
3. **Admin Panel Tests** - Validate administrative functions
4. **Integration Tests** - Ensure all systems work together
5. **Performance Tests** - Verify platform stability
6. **Edge Case Tests** - Test error handling and edge scenarios

# Expected Results:
# - All endpoints return 200 status
# - Health endpoints return JSON with status data
# - No 500 or 404 errors
Test 1.2: Authentication System
typescript// Test authentication flow
TEST_STEPS = [
  "1. Visit https://soukk.art (unauthenticated)",
