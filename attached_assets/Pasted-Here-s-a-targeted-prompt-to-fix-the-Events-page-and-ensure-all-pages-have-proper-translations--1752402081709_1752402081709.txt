Here's a targeted prompt to fix the Events page and ensure all pages have proper translations:

```
Fix translation keys showing on the Events page and verify ALL pages in the application have working translations.

COMPLETE PAGE AUDIT:

1. CHECK ALL MAIN PAGES:
   Go through EACH page file and verify translations:
   - client/src/pages/Home.tsx
   - client/src/pages/Events.tsx ⚠️ (reported issue)
   - client/src/pages/Workshops.tsx
   - client/src/pages/Artworks.tsx
   - client/src/pages/ArtworkDetail.tsx
   - client/src/pages/Artists.tsx
   - client/src/pages/ArtistProfile.tsx
   - client/src/pages/Galleries.tsx
   - client/src/pages/GalleryProfile.tsx
   - client/src/pages/Auctions.tsx
   - client/src/pages/AuctionDetail.tsx
   - client/src/pages/CommissionRequests.tsx
   - client/src/pages/CommissionDetail.tsx
   - client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
   - client/src/pages/CollectorDashboard.tsx
   - client/src/pages/SellerDashboard.tsx
   - client/src/pages/Analytics.tsx
   - client/src/pages/UserPreferences.tsx
   - client/src/pages/Search.tsx
   - client/src/pages/Collections.tsx
   - client/src/pages/CollectionDetail.tsx
   - client/src/pages/Articles.tsx
   - client/src/pages/ArticleDetail.tsx
   - client/src/pages/VirtualExhibitions.tsx
   - client/src/pages/VirtualExhibitionDetail.tsx
   - client/src/pages/RoleSelection.tsx

2. SPECIFICALLY FIX EVENTS PAGE:
   In client/src/pages/Events.tsx:
   - List ALL t() calls used in this file
   - Check each key exists in i18n.ts resources
   - Add any missing keys like:
     * events.title
     * events.subtitle
     * events.featured
     * events.upcoming
     * events.categories.*
     * events.filters.*
     * events.noResults
     * events.viewDetails
     * events.register
     * events.free
     * events.paid

3. ADD COMPREHENSIVE EVENTS TRANSLATIONS:
   In client/src/lib/i18n.ts, add to resources:
   ```typescript
   events: {
     title: "Art Events",
     subtitle: "Discover exhibitions, talks, and networking opportunities",
     featured: "Featured Events",
     upcoming: "Upcoming Events",
     allEvents: "All Events",
     categories: {
       all: "All Categories",
       exhibition: "Exhibition",
       talk: "Talk",
       workshop: "Workshop",
       networking: "Networking",
       auction: "Auction",
       opening: "Opening"
     },
     filters: {
       date: "Date",
       category: "Category",
       location: "Location",
       price: "Price",
       online: "Online Events",
       inPerson: "In-Person Events"
     },
     status: {
       upcoming: "Upcoming",
       ongoing: "Ongoing",
       completed: "Completed",
       cancelled: "Cancelled"
     },
     details: {
       about: "About This Event",
       date: "Date & Time",
       location: "Location",
       organizer: "Organized by",
       price: "Price",
       free: "Free",
       register: "Register",
       registered: "Registered",
       attendees: "Attendees",
       maxAttendees: "Max Attendees",
       description: "Description",
       agenda: "Agenda",
       speakers: "Speakers"
     },
     noResults: "No events found",
     viewDetails: "View Details",
     register: "Register Now",
     share: "Share Event"
   }
   ```

4. CHECK WORKSHOPS PAGE TOO:
   Since Events and Workshops are similar, ensure Workshops has all keys:
   ```typescript
   workshops: {
     title: "Art Workshops",
     subtitle: "Learn from master artists and develop your skills",
     featured: "Featured Workshops",
     upcoming: "Upcoming Workshops",
     skillLevels: {
       all: "All Levels",
       beginner: "Beginner",
       intermediate: "Intermediate", 
       advanced: "Advanced"
     },
     // ... similar structure to events
   }
   ```

5. TEST NAVIGATION TO ALL PAGES:
   - Click through EVERY menu item
   - Visit EVERY page type
   - Note ANY page showing translation keys
   - Fix them immediately

6. ADD MISSING PAGE TITLES:
   Ensure these exist in resources:
   ```typescript
   pageTitle: {
     home: "Home",
     artworks: "Browse Artworks",
     artists: "Discover Artists",
     galleries: "Art Galleries",
     auctions: "Live Auctions",
     events: "Art Events",
     workshops: "Art Workshops",
     commissions: "Commission Requests",
     dashboard: "My Dashboard",
     profile: "Profile",
     settings: "Settings"
   }
   ```

7. CREATE A PAGE CHECKLIST:
   Create file: pages-translation-check.txt
   ```
   ✅ Home - All translations working
   ❌ Events - Missing keys: [list them]
   ✅ Workshops - All translations working
   ... check every page
   ```

8. QUICK FIX FOR ANY REMAINING KEYS:
   For any page still showing keys, add this temporary fix at the top:
   ```typescript
   const { t, i18n } = useTranslation();
   
   // Debug helper
   useEffect(() => {
     console.log(`${PageName} page - Language:`, i18n.language);
     console.log(`${PageName} page - Sample key:`, t('events.title'));
   }, [i18n.language]);
   ```

9. VERIFY ARABIC TRANSLATIONS:
   For every English key added, ensure Arabic exists:
   ```typescript
   ar: {
     events: {
       title: "الفعاليات الفنية",
       subtitle: "اكتشف المعارض والمحاضرات وفرص التواصل",
       // ... etc
     }
   }
   ```

10. FINAL VERIFICATION:
    - Visit /events page
    - Confirm no translation keys visible
    - Switch to Arabic and verify
    - Test all interactive elements

Report back with:
1. Confirmation that Events page is fixed
2. List of any other pages that had issues
3. Total number of missing keys that were added
```

This will ensure the Events page and all other pages display proper translations instead of keys.
