The translation system is working (confirmed by diagnostics), but some translation keys are still showing in the UI. Fix the remaining translation key displays:

TASKS:

1. SEARCH AND FIX ALL T() CALLS:
   Search for all instances of {t(" in the entire codebase
   For each one found, verify the key exists in the inline resources in i18n.ts
   If any key is missing, add it to the inline resources

2. CHECK FOR INCORRECT KEY PATHS:
   Search for patterns like:
   - t('nav.home') when it should be t('nav.artworks')
   - t('common.loading') when it should be t('common.loading')
   
3. FIX DYNAMIC KEY CONSTRUCTION:
   Find patterns like: t(`nav.${variable}`)
   Ensure the variable values match actual keys in resources
   Add console.log before these to debug what key is being requested

4. ADD MISSING KEYS TO INLINE RESOURCES:
   In client/src/lib/i18n.ts, add any missing keys found:
   - If you find t('workshops.title') being used but not defined
   - Add it to the resources object in both en and ar sections

5. CHECK CONDITIONAL RENDERING:
   Look for patterns where translation might be called before ready:
   ```typescript
   const { t, ready } = useTranslation();
   if (!ready) return null;

SEARCH FOR RAW STRING KEYS:
Search for any hardcoded strings that look like translation keys:

"nav.home" (with quotes)
'auth.login' (with quotes)
These might be displayed directly instead of being translated


CHECK FOR TEMPLATE LITERAL ISSUES:
Find and fix patterns like:

{t("key")} should be {t("key")}
"${t('key')}" should be {t('key')}


VERIFY ALL COMPONENTS IMPORT useTranslation:
Search for components that display text but don't have:
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
ADD COMPREHENSIVE LOGGING:
In any component still showing keys, add:
typescriptconsole.log('Component X - Key:', 'nav.home', 'Value:', t('nav.home'));

SPECIFICALLY CHECK THESE COMMON PROBLEM AREAS:

Footer component
Dashboard pages
Modal/Dialog components
Error messages
Form labels
Button texts
Placeholder texts


LOOK FOR NESTED KEYS NOT IN RESOURCES:
The inline resources might be missing deeply nested keys like:

dashboard.artist.stats.totalArtworks
forms.validation.required
errors.network.timeout



For each missing key found, add it to the inline resources in i18n.ts.
Report back with:

List of components that were still showing keys
List of missing keys that were added
Confirmation that all keys now display proper text
