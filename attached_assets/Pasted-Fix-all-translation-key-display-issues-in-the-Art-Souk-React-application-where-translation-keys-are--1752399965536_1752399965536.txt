Fix all translation key display issues in the Art Souk React application where translation keys are showing instead of actual translated text.

CONTEXT:
- React 18 + TypeScript application using react-i18next
- Translation files located at: client/src/locales/en.json and client/src/locales/ar.json
- i18n configuration at: client/src/lib/i18n.ts
- Translation keys are appearing as text (e.g., "nav.home" instead of "Home")

TASKS TO COMPLETE:

1. UPDATE i18n CONFIGURATION (client/src/lib/i18n.ts):
   - Ensure proper initialization with resources loading
   - Add debug: true temporarily
   - Ensure both en and ar translations are properly imported
   - Set fallbackLng to 'en'
   - Make sure interpolation.escapeValue is false

2. UPDATE MAIN ENTRY FILE (client/src/main.tsx):
   - Import './lib/i18n' BEFORE importing App
   - Ensure i18n is initialized before React renders

3. UPDATE APP.TSX:
   - Wrap the entire app with I18nextProvider
   - Import i18n from './lib/i18n'
   - Ensure QueryClientProvider is inside I18nextProvider

4. CHECK AND FIX ALL TRANSLATION FILES:
   - Verify JSON structure in en.json and ar.json matches the key usage
   - Ensure all keys used in components exist in translation files
   - Fix any missing translations for: nav, auth, workshops, events, commissions, dashboard, artworks, artists, galleries, auctions, common sections

5. FIX COMPONENT IMPORTS:
   - Search for all useTranslation() usage
   - Ensure they're imported from 'react-i18next'
   - Remove any namespace specifications unless needed

6. ADD MISSING TRANSLATIONS:
   - Search for all t('...') usage in the codebase
   - Extract all translation keys
   - Ensure every key exists in both en.json and ar.json files

7. COMMON KEYS TO ENSURE EXIST:
   - nav.* (home, artworks, artists, galleries, auctions, workshops, events, commissions)
   - auth.* (login, logout, dashboard)
   - common.* (search, filter, sort, loading, error, success)
   - dashboard.* (all dashboard related texts)
   - workshops.* (all workshop related texts)
   - events.* (all event related texts)
   - commissions.* (all commission related texts)

8. TEST THE FIX:
   - Add console.log in App.tsx to verify translations are loaded
   - Check that language switching between English and Arabic works
   - Ensure no translation keys are visible in the UI

9. REMOVE DEBUG MODE:
   - Once fixed, remove debug: true from i18n config

Please complete all these tasks and ensure that all translation keys throughout the application are replaced with their actual translated text values.
